In between the trip we had so much fun, and the best part we got free sugarcane right from the farm. When we reached the falls, it was huge!!!!!!! So huge that I had to angle my neck at least 45 degrees. It was not at all a waste of time and I think you should visit it too because it is very beautiful.</p>

            <p>The less you know going into Avengers: Endgame, the more you’re likely to enjoy it. Obviously, you wouldn’t have clicked on a review of this movie if you didn’t want to know something about the culmination of a decade’s worth of Marvel’s superhero storytelling, but trust me: more than Avengers: Infinity War, more than any Star Wars movie, Endgame is truly a story that needs to be experienced. Forget all the external noise from the deliberately vague teaser trailers, perfectly-calibrated celebrity soundbites, and footage leaks, and just strap in for the ride.</p>

Schools aim that they will be able to be 100 percent vaccinated by July 30. Schools said that they have launched their preparations at their own level. “Everyone knows the importance of vaccination. We know that schools will also be opening in the near future. We have launched vaccination of our staff to ensure safety of each member associated with the school. We will achieve 100% vaccination on our school campus before July 30,” said D Ashok, principal, Gyan Ganga International Academy.</p>

        <h4>Sole Hosp for 25 Rajpur Villages Not Prepared for Third Wave in HP</h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">As India recovers from the deadly second wave of COVID-19, doctors and other health workers are bracing for a third wave. State governments, too, are putting mechanisms in place to make sure there is no shortage of medical supplies.
However, modern infrastructure and necessary medical staffers are still not visible at the Community Healthcare Centre (CHC) in Rajpur, a rural area in Sirmaur, Himachal Pradesh. This is the only hospital for more than 25 villages in the district, which have a population of approximately 40,000. The infrastructure of the CHC is on the verge of collapse. I visited the hospital on 22 June to see it for myself.
Recently, a report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) revealed that rural districts accounted for 52 percent of all COVID deaths and 53 percent of all new cases registered in India in May. The report further stated that community health centres in rural India need 76 percent more doctors, 56 percent more radiographers, and 35 percent more lab technicians.</p>
